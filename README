We present PhyloPipe, a graphical pipe-lining software for phylogenomic analysis. 
PhyloPipe combines a collection of widely used software in phylogenomic research, HaMStR, MAFFT, MUSCLE, Aliscore and RaxmlGUI, together with intermediate procedures into an integrated pipeline. It provides a graphical user interface manipulating the compiled input files of annotated transcriptomic data into a RAxML-compatible format, which can be used to generate a phylogenetic tree.
